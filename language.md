# Fel language
Fel is greatly inspired by a mix of javascript and lua.

# Comments
Fel uses c-style comments with the distinction that multi line comments can be nested.

```javascript
// single line comment

/* multi line
   /* this comment is commented out */
   comment */
```

# Functions

```javascript
foo();
bar(42);
baz(1, 2, 3);
```

# Strings

```javascript
"there are double quotes"
'and single quotes'
'and escapes \n\r\t\'\" and \\'
"all \'escape\' characters work in both strings"
```
